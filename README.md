# django_chat_app
This app was created in part of self-taught through youtube with the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtQiiknWUcI

This course goes through the fundamentals and various different aspects of the django framework. This project consists of a function user chat app where users can 
create accounts, login, and access content for their account. Users can create chat rooms, create messages, etc. All of this functionality is blocked if the user is not 
properly authenticated. Also, the user can only remove content that they have created. The project also goes over detailed query results so the user can search for rooms, 
messages, etc. Lastly, the html and css was granted through the video. On top of that, the video explains django's built in template engine.
